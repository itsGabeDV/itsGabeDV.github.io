Welcome to my project showcase. Below are some of the projects I have had the pleasure of working on.

## Project Deep Dives

### Mayo Clinic Research
My research team and I built 3D models by capturing data using a Microsoft Kinect Camera. We refined these models in Blender to ensure anatomical accuracy. Once prepared, we gathered PSD data using a custom Python calculator and compared results against real-world fluoroscopy data.

### Unity Tower Defense Game
I am passionate about C# scripting and game development. I completed this game as an honors project, navigating the challenges of game physics and state management. Feel free to try the game out—download below, extract the ZIP, and run the `.exe` file to play!
